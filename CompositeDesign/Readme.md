When you whole system ro part fo system can be represented as Tree like structure
Then we have complex/non-complex objevts as well so we can consider it same by providing same interface and some of operations to it, by this way we represent our whole structure in Tree which must contain some leaf obvisouly for tree structure.

The Composite Pattern solves the problem of managing and working with tree structures, making it possible to treat a single object and a collection of objects the same way.
